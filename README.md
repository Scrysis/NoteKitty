Do you long for a note-taking app that only approximates a real database?

Look no further!  NoteKitty NoteTaker is an app that combines beautiful front-end
beauty with backend functionality.

This project was an exercise where front end code was provided (source: https://github.com/coding-boot-camp/miniature-eureka)
and the student was responsible for writing the back-end functionality.

This web app saves notes to a json file that mimics a database, and taking
advantage of the pre-built functionality, the backend was written so that notes
can be read, written, AND deleted.

The whole project is uploaded to Heroku:
